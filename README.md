### Robustness of audio-visual learning under multimodal attacks

we propose to make a systematic study on machinesâ€™ multisensory perception under attacks. We
use the audio-visual event recognition task against multimodal adversarial attacks as a proxy to investigate the robustness of audio-visual learning. We attack audio, visual,
and both modalities to explore whether audio-visual integration still strengthens perception and how different fusion
mechanisms affect the robustness of audio-visual models.

### Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements
```
### Audio-Visual Attack
There are typos in the captions of Tab. 1 and Tab. 3. The perturbation strengthens are 0.006 and 0.012 as in Fig. 3 (10^-3) rather than 0.06 and 0.12.

Training:


```bash
./scripts/train_attack_MUSIC.sh
```

```bash
./scripts/train_attack_AVE.sh
```

```bash
./scripts/train_attack_Kinetics.sh
```

Testing: 

```bash
./scripts/eval_attack_MUSIC.sh
```

```bash
./scripts/eval_attack_AVE.sh
```


```bash
./scripts/eval_attack_Kinetics.sh
```


### Audio-Visual Defense against Multimodal Attacks 

Training:

```bash
./scripts/train_defense_MUSIC.sh
```

```bash
